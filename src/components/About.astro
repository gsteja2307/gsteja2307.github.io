			I'm a <strong>Senior Full-Stack Engineer</strong>, <strong>Data Scientist</strong>, and <strong>AI enthusiast</strong> with over 6 years of hands-on experience crafting scalable, enterprise-grade solutions in the financial technology sector. My passion lies at the intersection of robust software engineering, data-driven insights, and cutting-edge AI technologies.

			<h4 class="font-semibold text-orange mb-2">üöÄ Current Role & Impact</h4>
			<p class="text-sm mb-2">
				At <strong>Lloyds Technology Centre</strong>, I lead development teams on the <strong>International Payment Modernisation</strong> initiative, architecting next-generation payment systems that handle millions of transactions. My work spans Open Banking v4 compliance, PSD2 regulations, and real-time payment processing infrastructure.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			My engineering journey began at <strong>Fission Infotech</strong>, where I discovered my love for full-stack development through React Native and MERN stack projects. This foundation led me to <strong>Arcserve</strong>, where I contributed to their flagship SaaS data backup platform, achieving remarkable milestones like 80% test coverage and complete module rewrites that enhanced user experience for thousands of customers.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			The pivotal chapter of my career unfolded at <strong>DBS Bank</strong>, where I evolved from an Associate to an informal front-end team leader on the Branch Connect project. Here, I spearheaded performance optimization initiatives that delivered 30% load time improvements and 20% latency reductions, directly impacting the daily operations of bank branches across Southeast Asia.

			<h4 class="font-semibold text-orange mb-2">üéì Academic Foundation</h4>
			<p class="text-sm">
				My <strong>M.Tech in Data Science & Engineering from BITS Pilani</strong> provides the theoretical backbone for my practical innovations. This dual expertise in software engineering and data science enables me to build not just functional applications, but intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and optimize themselves.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			As a <strong>Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer</strong>, I bring cloud-native architecture expertise to every project. My open-source contributions, including the popular <strong>runtime-memory-cache</strong> npm package, reflect my commitment to giving back to the developer community and exploring innovative performance optimization techniques.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			Currently, I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> and agentic AI systems. This exploration represents the future convergence of traditional software engineering with intelligent, context-aware applications that can understand, reason, and act autonomously.

			<h4 class="font-semibold text-orange mb-2">üí° Philosophy & Approach</h4>
			<p class="text-sm">
				I believe in writing code that not only solves today's problems but anticipates tomorrow's challenges. Whether it's implementing micro-frontends for scalability, optimizing memory caching for performance, or exploring AI integration possibilities, I approach every project with curiosity, precision, and a commitment to excellence.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p class="mb-6 text-base">
			Beyond coding, I'm passionate about <strong>mentoring emerging developers</strong> and sharing knowledge through technical presentations. My three Show & Tell recognitions at Lloyds specifically focused on Open Banking innovations demonstrate my ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively.
