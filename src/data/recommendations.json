      "text": "I had the pleasure of working with Surya Teja in the same team at Lloyds, and it's been a great experience. He is a highly skilled full stack developer with strong technical and domain knowledge. Surya consistently delivers high-quality work and has resolved several complex issues that others in the team couldn't. His code is clean, well-structured, and aligned with best practices. Surya played a key role in impact analysis for the v4 upgrade, IPM, and several Open Banking componentsâ€”handling everything with ease and precision. He also fixed critical build errors that no one else in the team was able to resolve. Beyond his technical skills, Surya is always approachable and willing to help others, explaining things clearly and patiently. We've worked closely on multiple initiatives, and collaborating with him has always made me feel confident and well-supported. Surya is a true asset to any team, and I highly recommend him.",
